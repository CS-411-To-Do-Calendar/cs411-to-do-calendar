----- Idea 1 - To Do Calendar ------
  This app would be used to accumulate a to-do list schedule and help users to overlook
  work deadlines and progress. Our target audience for such an app would be college students and
  office workers, or just about anyone who needs to organize many tasks and thus increase their work
  efficiency. This could be used for daily work, creating a connection between items to complete
  and their deadlines on a calnedar in a more efficient way than google calendar alone. We would
  want to connect this app to Google Calendar, but we want to create a more efficient way of
  adding events to the calendar. With this app we could create a calendar block. When this is created,
  we will ask if there is a certain task that needs to be done. If so, it will be added to a task
  block.

----- Idea 2 - Gym Buddy -----
  This is an app that would target anyone who wants a healthier lifestyle. For example, college students,
  white collar workers, and even gamers. It would be used for assisting in daily workouts in any location
  with access to the internet. This app would help in creating gym programs and gym groups by lifting
  level. Generally, it would encourage a healthy lifestyle, keeping track of consistency and gains.
